We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too. We'll do another happy little painting. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license.

Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. Do an almighty painting with us. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees.

We have a fantastic little sky! Maybe there's a little something happening right here. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. Let your imagination be your guide. You can create anything that makes you happy. Let's have a happy little tree in here.

A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. Trees cover up a multitude of sins. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer.

Now then, let's play. And right there you got an almighty cloud. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. Let's put some happy trees and [bushes back in here](www.google.com).

There it is. We'll put a happy little sky in here. Let all these things just sort of happen.

> That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. Let's do it again then, what the heck. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. We'll throw some happy little limbs on this tree. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first.
